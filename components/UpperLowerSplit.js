    <h2>Upper/Lower Workout Split</h2>
    <p>
      The upper/lower split divides workouts into upper body and lower body
      sessions. Typically, you would perform these workouts on alternating days,
      4 days a week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday).
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Focused Training:</strong> Allows for more focused and intense
        training of specific muscle groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Better Recovery:</strong> By alternating between upper and lower
        body, each muscle group gets more recovery time while still allowing you
        to train frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Variety:</strong> Keeps workouts interesting by varying the
        focus of each session.
