    <h2>Push/Pull/Legs Split</h2>
    <p>
      The push/pull/legs split separates workouts into pushing movements (chest,
      shoulders, triceps), pulling movements (back, biceps), and leg exercises.
      This split is commonly performed over 3 to 6 days a week, depending on
      your fitness level and goals.
