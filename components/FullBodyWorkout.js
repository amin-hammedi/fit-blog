    <h2>Full Body Workout Split</h2>
    <p>
      A full body workout split involves training all major muscle groups in a
      single session. This split is typically performed 2-3 times per week, with
      a day of rest in between sessions.

    <h3>Benefits:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Efficient Use of Time:</strong> By working all major muscle
        groups in one session, you maximize your workout efficiency, which is
        great for those with a busy schedule.

        overtraining and injury.
